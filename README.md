# Physics Engine
## Introduction
This project is for Dartmouth CS 277 CG Final project.  
We aspire to develop a comprehensive physics engine that mirrors the sophisticated physics engine effects present in popular game development platforms like Unity and other mainstream game engines.
This entails incorporating a range of features, including but not limited to rigid bodies, colliders, cloth and additional functionalities to enhance the realism and versatility of the physics simulation.


## Building
This project is based on [allolib](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib/) which supports MacOS/Linux/Windows(some extra [steps](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib/) for building on Windows). And it's a OpenGL toolbox.``
To build Physics Allolib, follow these steps:
```
./update.sh
./configure.sh
./run.sh
```
If these thell don't work for your system, please See [steps](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib/) how to build on your platform, these shells work on Mac.
